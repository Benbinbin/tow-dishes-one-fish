<p align="center">A VuePress-next template to build a static web site as blog and knowledge management system.</p>

## Introduction
*"Two dishes one fish"* is a smart cuisine using different part of one fish to make two delicious dishes, inspired by it I want to build web site as a blog and a knowledge management system, with the same Markdown files system.

I choose [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/) as the generator to compile the Markdown files to HTML files and deploy the static site to Github Page.

VuePress is so easy to use by the out-of-the-box default theme just [setting some configurations](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/reference/default-theme/config.html). My major work is to optimise the experience of browser the website and post:

* the Markdown files can classify into tow types, it can be a blog post and a note at the same time, or just as a note.
* add a blog posts navigation page, the blog post show as cards, user can browser the posts in three mode: cards grid mode, cards masonry mode, and posts list mode.
* add a notes navigation page, all Markdown files will be notes, the notes show in a grid layout as the same structure as they save in the files system, powering by [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), you can also browser the notes in a tree chart.
* support to add tags to Markdown file and filter the posts or notes in navigation page.
* follow the RWD, responsive web design, principle, you can browser the website in different screen size.
